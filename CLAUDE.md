## Project Overview

This is a documentation project for creating "awesome-claude-code-zh" - a Chinese language curated list of Claude Code resources. The project aims to build a GitHub repository showcasing selected resources for Claude Code in Chinese.

## Repository Structure

- `context/` - Contains project documentation and reference materials
  - `official_doc.txt` - Links to official Claude Code documentation in Chinese

- Tools and integrations
- Examples and use cases

## Development Notes

This is primarily a documentation and resource curation project. The main deliverable will be a well-structured README.md file with organized sections of Claude Code resources in Chinese.
